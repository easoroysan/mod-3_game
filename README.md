# mod-3_game
project for module 3 of flatiron school

If you are loading up the code on your computer, rails db:migrate and rails:db seed in the backend folder. In 'frontend/src/variables.js', you will have to change the userURL and savefilesURL to whatever URL your database uses (localhost:3000 is default for using rails on localhost)

#Bugs/Improvements
character max walking height doesn't changed based on background (looks like characters are walking in the sky)
implement bcrypt
add bosses
change database to Postgres instead of SQLite
save image/gif background rather than referencing another url in the css files
when attacking at moment of death, freezes animation and can still be controlled
